# Introduction to CSS

## Overview
Following the completion of HTML basics, this section introduces **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets), recognized as the "second language of the web." The primary function of CSS is to **style the content** written in HTML.

## Section Goals
The objective of this section is to combine practical application with theoretical understanding:

*   **Project Development:** Continue building the current project by adding **visual styles** to the HTML structure.
*   **Theoretical Foundations:** Learn the underlying concepts of CSS to understand how it functions mechanically.

## Importance of Theory
Understanding the theory behind CSS is crucial for the following reason:
*   It ensures that when you begin writing your own code, you possess a deep understanding of **what you are doing** and **how the language works**, rather than just memorizing syntax.

## Summary
*   **CSS Role:** Styling HTML content.
*   **Approach:** Mix of practical styling (project work) and theoretical concepts.
*   **Outcome:** Ability to write code with a clear understanding of its mechanics.
