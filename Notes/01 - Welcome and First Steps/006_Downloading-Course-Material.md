### Detailed Breakdown

#### 1. Accessing the Course Repository

-   **Location:** All course files (starter and final versions) are stored in a **repository** on GitHub.
-   **What is GitHub?** A code platform where developers upload, share, and collaborate on code. A repository is essentially a project folder.
-   **How to Access:**
    -   A direct URL to the repository is provided within the course lecture on Udemy.
    -   The link can also be found in the first text lecture of the section.
    -   You do not need to type the URL manually; simply click the provided link.

#### 2. Understanding the Repository Contents

The GitHub repository is organized to support your learning throughout the course. It contains:

-   **Starter Files:**
    -   A dedicated folder exists for each section of the course (e.g., "HTML fundamentals").
    -   These folders contain the necessary files, such as images and text documents, to begin each section.
-   **Final Files:**
    -   The repository also includes the final, completed code for each section.
    -   **Purpose:** This allows you to compare your work with the instructor's code, which is the easiest way to find and fix mistakes.
-   **FAQ Document:**
    -   A document at the bottom of the repository lists frequently asked questions.
    -   It is recommended to read this document (takes ~3 minutes) before starting the course to clear up potential doubts.

#### 3. Step-by-Step Download Instructions

Follow these steps to download all the files to your computer:

1.  Navigate to the course repository on GitHub using the provided link.
2.  Click the **green "Code" button** located on the page.
3.  From the dropdown menu, select the **"Download ZIP"** option.
4.  Wait for the download to complete. The file size may be large due to images.

#### 4. Extracting and Preparing the Files

Once the download is finished, you need to extract the files from the compressed ZIP archive.

1.  Locate the downloaded `.zip` file and move it to your preferred working location (e.g., your Desktop).
2.  **Extract the archive:**
    -   **On Mac:** Double-click the `.zip` file.
    -   **On Windows:** Right-click the `.zip` file and select **"Extract All..."**.
3.  After extraction, you can delete the original `.zip` file.
4.  Open the newly created folder to confirm that it contains the starter and final files, matching the structure seen on GitHub.
